description: Initialize project with CLAUDE.md and create comprehensive feature documentation
---

## Project Initialization & Feature Documentation

I will now:

1. **Initialize the project** by creating or updating CLAUDE.md with project context
2. **Analyze the codebase** to identify all major features
3. **Create detailed feature documentation** in `docs/development/features/`
4. **Update CLAUDE.md** with a feature index and extremely brief summary

Let me start by creating the initial CLAUDE.md file for this project, then systematically document every major feature.

## Task: Complete Feature Documentation

Your task is to summarize all the features in the code base.

1. **Identify each major feature** in this project. Features are any major functionality.

2. **Starting with the first feature, identify the relevant files.**

3. **Write a FEATURE_NAME.md file**, summarizing the feature, how it works, the files involved, etc and put this in `docs/development/features/`. It will be used by another developer, so they have all the information they need to work on the feature with very little other context. Keep it information dense, and brief.

4. **Repeat steps 2-3** for every other major feature.

5. **Finally, update the CLAUDE.md file** for the project. List all the features, with a reference to the file and an extremely brief summary of what that feature does.

Let me begin this comprehensive documentation process.
