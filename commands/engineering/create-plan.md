# Implementation Plan

You are tasked with creating detailed implementation plans through an interactive, iterative process. You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.

## Initial Response

When this command is invoked:

1. **Check if parameters were provided**:
   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message
   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY
   - Begin the research process

2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:

```
I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.

Please provide:
1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)
2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements
3. Links to related research or previous implementations

I'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.

Tip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan ~/.claude/thoughts/$USER/tickets/eng_1234.md`
For deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about ~/.claude/thoughts/$USER/tickets/eng_1234.md`
```

Then wait for the user's input.

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis

1. **Read all mentioned content (e.g. files, webpages) immediately and FULLY**:
   - Ticket files (e.g., `~/.claude/thoughts/$USER/tickets/eng_1234.md`)
   - Research documents
   - Related implementation plans
   - Any JSON/data files mentioned
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files (unless the user explicitly states otherwise (e.g. the file might be too large))
   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context
   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely (unless directed otherwise)

2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:
   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:
   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task
   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works
   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature
   - Use the **spotify-tool-researcher** agent if
     - spotify specific libraries/tools are mentioned
     - there are relevant Slack conversations
     - there are any Google Docs/Google Slides/Google Sheets etc. linked

   These agents will:
   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests
   - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)
   - Trace data flow and key functions
   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references
   - Find relevant documentation and conversations

3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:
   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant
   - Read them FULLY into the main context
   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding

4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:
   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code
   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings
   - Note assumptions that need verification
   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality

5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:

   ```
   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].

   I've found that:
   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]
   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]
   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]

   Questions that my research couldn't answer:
   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]
   - [Business logic clarification]
   - [Design preference that affects implementation]
   ```

   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.

### Step 2: Detect Domains for Specialized Research

After initial codebase research completes, analyze findings for domain-specific patterns.

**Scan the ticket, research findings, and codebase for domain patterns:**

@commands/shared/domain-agent-registry.md

**Spawn domain experts in parallel with standard research agents:**

For each detected domain, spawn the corresponding expert with this prompt:

```
Provide [DOMAIN] expertise for planning this implementation:

## Task Context
{{TICKET_SUMMARY}}

## Codebase Findings
{{INITIAL_RESEARCH_FINDINGS}}

## Research Focus
- Identify [DOMAIN]-specific considerations for this task
- Suggest [DOMAIN] patterns and approaches to follow
- Highlight [DOMAIN] risks, constraints, or best practices
- Reference [DOMAIN] documentation and examples
- Note any [DOMAIN]-specific testing requirements
```

Include domain expert findings in the plan's research section.

**Required: Agent Type Verification**

@commands/shared/agent-verification-pattern.md

Create the agent contract listing standard research agents (codebase-locator, codebase-analyzer, thoughts-locator, spotify-tool-researcher) plus any domain-based agents detected above.

### Step 3: Research & Discovery

After getting initial clarifications:

1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:
   - DO NOT just accept the correction
   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information
   - Read the specific files/directories they mention
   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself

2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks

**REQUIRED: Pre-Spawn Verification**

Before spawning, output verification table matching contract. If skipping any agent, provide reason and inform user.

@commands/shared/pre-spawn-verification.md

3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:
   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently
   - Use the right agent for each type of research:

   @commands/shared/subagent-types.md

   Each agent knows how to:
   - Find the right files and code patterns
   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow
   - Look for integration points and dependencies
   - Return specific file:line references
   - Find tests and examples

   **MANDATORY (run in parallel with above): Search for existing reusable patterns**

   As part of the parallel sub-task spawning, ALWAYS include a dedicated task to find existing abstractions:
   - Use **codebase-pattern-finder** with prompts like:
     - "Find all abstract classes, interfaces, or base classes related to [component type]"
     - "Find what classes extend or implement the same interface as [similar existing feature]"
     - "Search for `abstract class`, `interface`, `Protocol`, `trait` in [relevant directory]"

   **What to look for:**
   - Abstract classes that handle boilerplate (e.g., `AbstractGrpcTool`, `BaseHandler`)
   - Interfaces that define contracts for the type of component you're building
   - Existing implementations that can be modeled after
   - Factory patterns, builder patterns, or other design patterns in use

   **If reusable patterns are found:**
   - Document them explicitly in your findings
   - Evaluate if the new implementation should extend/implement them
   - If the existing pattern conflicts with a prior research doc's approach, flag this for discussion

4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding

5. **Present findings and design options**:

   ```
   Based on my research, here's what I found:

   **Current State:**
   - [Key discovery about existing code]
   - [Pattern or convention to follow]

   **Design Options:**
   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]
   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]

   **Open Questions:**
   - [Technical uncertainty]
   - [Design decision needed]

   Which approach aligns best with your vision?
   ```

### Step 4: Plan Structure Development

Once aligned on approach:

1. **Create initial plan outline**:

   ```
   Here's my proposed plan structure:

   ## Overview
   [1-2 sentence summary]

   ## Implementation Phases:
   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]

   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?
   ```

2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details

### Step 5: Detailed Plan Writing

After structure approval:

1. **Write the plan** to `~/.claude/thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:
     - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date
     - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)
     - description is a brief kebab-case description
   - Examples:
     - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`
     - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-improve-error-handling.md`
2. **Use this template structure**:

````markdown
# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan

## Overview

[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]

## Current State Analysis

[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]

## Desired End State

[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]

### Key Discoveries:

## Existing Patterns Analysis

**REQUIRED**: Document existing abstractions/patterns that were considered for this implementation.

### Patterns Found:

| Pattern                         | Location                | Usage Count       | Applicable? |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| [Abstract class/Interface name] | `path/to/file.ext:line` | X existing usages | Yes/No      |
| ...                             | ...                     | ...               | ...         |

### Decision:

- **Will use**: [Pattern name] because [reason]
- **Will NOT use**: [Pattern name] because [reason - e.g., doesn't fit our use case because X]

### Deviation from Prior Research (if applicable):

> **Note**: The research document `~/.claude/thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-xxx.md` proposed [approach X],
> but based on pattern analysis, this plan uses [approach Y] instead because [reason].
>
> Key differences:
>
> - Research proposed: [original approach]
> - This plan uses: [new approach leveraging existing pattern]
> - Rationale: [why the pattern-based approach is better]

````

### Step 6: Sync and Review

1. **Present the draft plan location**:
   - Create `~/.claude/thoughts/shared/plans/` directory if it doesn't exist already.

   ```
   I've created the initial implementation plan at:
   `~/.claude/thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`

   Please review it and let me know:
   - Are the phases properly scoped?
   - Are the success criteria specific enough?
   - Any technical details that need adjustment?
   - Missing edge cases or considerations?
   ```

2. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:
   - Add missing phases
   - Adjust technical approach
   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)
   - Add/remove scope items

3. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Skeptical**:
   - Question vague requirements
   - Identify potential issues early
   - Ask "why" and "what about"
   - Don't assume - verify with code

2. **Be Interactive**:
   - Don't write the full plan in one shot
   - Get buy-in at each major step
   - Allow course corrections
   - Work collaboratively

3. **Be Thorough**:
   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning
   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers
   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction

4. **Be Practical**:
   - Focus on incremental, testable changes
   - Consider migration and rollback
   - Think about edge cases
   - Include "what we're NOT doing"

5. **Track Progress**:
   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks
   - Update todos as you complete research
   - Mark planning tasks complete when done

6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:
   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP
   - Research or ask for clarification immediately
   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions
   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable
   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan

7. **Leverage Existing Patterns**:
   - ALWAYS search for abstract classes, interfaces, and base classes before designing new components
   - If an existing pattern has 3+ usages, prefer extending it over creating something new
   - If your approach differs from a prior research doc due to pattern discovery, document this explicitly
   - The "Existing Patterns Analysis" section is REQUIRED in every implementation plan

## Success Criteria Guidelines

**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**

1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):
   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `sbt scalafmtAll`, etc.
   - Specific files that should exist
   - Code compilation/type checking
   - Automated test suites

2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):
   - UI/UX functionality
   - Performance under real conditions
   - Edge cases that are hard to automate
   - User acceptance criteria

**Format example:**

```markdown
### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:

- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`
- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`
- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`

#### Manual Verification:

- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices
```

## Common Patterns

### For Database Changes:

- Start with schema/migration
- Add store methods
- Update business logic
- Expose via API
- Update clients

### For New Features:

- Research existing patterns first
- Start with data model
- Build backend logic
- Add API endpoints
- Implement UI last

### For Refactoring:

- Document current behavior
- Plan incremental changes
- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Include migration strategy

## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices

When spawning research sub-tasks:

1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency
2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area
3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:
   - Exactly what to search for
   - Which directories to focus on
   - What information to extract
   - Expected output format
4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:
   - Never use generic terms like when more specific terms are available
   - Include the full path context in your prompts
5. **Specify read-only tools** to use
6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses
7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing
8. **Verify sub-task results**:
   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks
   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase
   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect

Example of spawning multiple tasks:

```python
# Spawn these tasks concurrently:
tasks = [
    Task("Research database schema", db_research_prompt),
    Task("Find API patterns", api_research_prompt),
    Task("Investigate UI components", ui_research_prompt),
    Task("Check test patterns", test_research_prompt)
]
```

## Example Interaction Flow

```
User: /implementation_plan
Assistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...

User: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See ~/.claude/thoughts/$USER/tickets/eng_1478.md
Assistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...

[Reads file fully]

Based on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...
